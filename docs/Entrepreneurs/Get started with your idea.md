## Funding

It is extremely difficult to get a project off the ground without funding.

### NEAR Foundation Grants

The NEAR Foundation is a non-profit responsible for contracting protocol maintainers, shepherding core governance of the NEAR protocol, and funding projects built on NEAR through grants. The biggest difference between venture capital funding and a grant from the NEAR Foundation is that the Foundation does not take any equity.

You can apply for grants here: <https://near.org/grants/>

### MOVE Capital

MOVE Capital is a NEAR ecosystem native investment vehicle. MOVE Capital exists to support founders and developers launching products on top of NEAR Protocol and run by the NEAR community.
